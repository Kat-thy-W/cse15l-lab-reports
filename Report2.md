- Which methods in your code are called?
  - String Server contains the main method, which call the server.start method.
  - Inside the server.start method, and new instance of StringHandler is created.
  - When the server is running, the handleRequest method under class StringHandler run once when a new web link is entered. As the Server method continues to run, we can keep calling the StringHandler visiting the site with desired path name.
